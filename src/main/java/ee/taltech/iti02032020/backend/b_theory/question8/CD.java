    //todo A
    // What is delivery?
    // Answer: Preparation of compiled and tested code for a upcoming building/packaging process, the build/package will go through final
    // testing phase before being submitted to be delivered to the user/client.


    //todo B
    // What makes delivery continuous?
    // Answer: Continuous delivery is a process of constantly preparing builds/packages for possible deployment to clients/users
    // in order to have working builds of a constantly developing project


    //todo C
    // In the class we had 3 stages in our CI/CD process, tick which ones stand for continuous delivery
    // [] compile
    // [] test
    // [x] deploy

    //todo D
    // Name and explain 1 benefit of CD
    // 1 No need to waste time on preparing the current build for a release, since the process has been automated and allows you to
    // deploy the changes on regular basis, along with the fact that the difference between the last build and the current is minimal
    // which is why it is a lot easier to fix potential bugs.

    //todo E
    // Name and explain 1 drawback of CD
    // 1 Quality of a release/deployment depends on the strictness of the test cases, deployments that pass testing stage
    // are not bug free and might impact the user on release even though they are not causing problems in the test cases.
    // Also there is a strong need of a reliable integration server for the automated tests and secure product delivery

    //todo F
    // Which one is more important to start with CI or CD? Why?
    // CI/CD: CI
    // Because: It ensures a more stable workflow the main goal of which is making the whole product being bug free,
    // instead of working on fixing specific bugs of features that are yet to be integrated into the project
