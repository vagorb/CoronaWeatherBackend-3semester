    //todo A
    // What is integration?
    // Integration is a process of connecting your data, applications APIs, features and devices across your IT organization to be more
    // efficient, productive and agile.




    //todo B
    // What makes integration continuous?
    // Answer: In software engineering, continuous integration (CI) is the practice of merging all
    // developers' working copies to a shared mainline several times a day
    // var 2
    // Continuous integration is a process of constant merging of branches and features to achieve a workflow where you have
    // everybody working on same code and branch base, which also allows for the testers to test out the current set of combined
    // features without being forced to test only specific parts of a feature or a branch

    //todo C
    // In the class we had 3 stages in our CI/CD process, tick [x] which ones stand for continuous integration
    // [x] compile
    // [x] test
    // [] deploy

    //todo D
    // Name and explain 1 benefit of CI
    // 1 You can find bugs in the code the moment they were introduced with the latest push without having to manually search for it
    // through a set of big changes that were recently merged in preparation for a release

    //todo E
    // Name and explain 1 drawback of CI
    // 1 Developers have to spend a lot more time on creating tests because instead of developing a single feature in isolation
    // they now also have to adjust it to changes/features developed by other developers in other branches constantly


    //todo F
    // In the class we are using gitlab-ci. Name 2 alternatives to it
    // 1 Travis CI
    // 2 CircleCI
