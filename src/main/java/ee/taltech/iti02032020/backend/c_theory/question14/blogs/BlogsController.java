    // This class should compile.
    // It should run successfully when moved to your application package.
    // Method body is not important and will not be graded.
    // Modifying other classes is unnecessary and will not be graded.

    //todo A add necessary annotations on the class

    //todo B create a method to query blogs (plural)

    //todo C create a method to query single blog

    //todo D create a method to save a new blog

    //todo E create a method to update a bog

    //todo F create a method to delete a blog

    //todo G assuming each blog has only 1 author (one-to-one relation) create a method to query blog's author

    //todo H create a method to update blog url (and nothing else)

    //todo I-J modify correct method to support pagination, pagination is done by page and size
    //todo I add page (pagination starts at page 1)
    //todo J add size (default page size is 20)

    //todo K modify correct method to order blogs
    // * by most recent first
    // * by least recent first
    // (you can assume that by default it searches by most popular first)
