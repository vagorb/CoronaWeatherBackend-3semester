    // You are creating a rest controller for chairs.
    // Think a backoffice system for furniture shop like Aatrium or some Kalamaja chair boutique.
    // You need to add necessary annotations and methods to this class.
    // This class should compile.
    // It should run successfully when moved to your application package.
    // Method body is not important and will not be graded.
    // Modifying other classes is unnecessary and will not be graded.

    //todo A add necessary annotations on the class

    //todo B create a method to query chairs (plural)

    //todo C create a method to query single chair

    //todo D create a method to save a chair

    //todo E create a method to update a chair

    //todo F create a method to delete a chair

    //todo G assuming each chair has a designer (one-to-one relation) create a method to query chair's designer

    //todo H create a method to update chair's name (and nothing else)

    //todo I modify correct method to support searching chairs by type while keeping original functionality

    //todo J modify correct method to support searching chairs by whether chair is in stock while keeping original functionality

    //todo K modify correct method to order/sort chairs
    // * by lowest priced first
    // * by highest priced first
    // (you can assume that by default it searches most popular first)
