    // Make sure to commit under your user otherwise points won't count.
    // I didn't number these so you can pick your favorite

    //todo create a working api for a sheep farm
    // It compiles and runs. You need to use proper annotations, methods, etc, however to ease the process you can use empty methods (examples below).
    // Follow the story to have only the necessary methods in it

    //todo 1
    // Ireland.
    // Sheep.
    // Ireland. The land of the sheep.
    // My name's Liam. I have sheep. Many, many sheep.
    // What do you call a sheep covered in chocolate? - A Candy Baa.
    // Yeah, that's a very funny. Jokes aside.
    // I need a backoffice system for my sheep.
    // The sheep in Ireland are in flux. They come, they go.
    // There are new sheep coming here all the time. I need to store new sheep to the database.
    // And then there are sheep leaving. They run away. I remember all my sheep.
    // The ones that are not there I want to remove them from my database.
    // Each sheep has a unique collar with a special code. I've always numbered my sheep.
    // Special code is just a number. It's a basic incrementing number, but I call it special because I can.
    // I want to access sheep details, it's name, age, everything using that code.
    // That's it. Can you do that for me?
