    //todo 1
    // Hello, my friend, my name is Ruslan, I like collecting art.
    // I have bought my first painting when I was 15.
    // By now I have the best collection on this side of river Volga.
    // I need to have a proper catalog. I have so much art.
    // I heard you have a very good brain. Very smart.
    // I need a big list for my great catalog. I don't want to search for my art, I want to see it.
    // There are many pages in a catalog. Each page has 50 results, so it's size is 50. I can change the size, but 50 is default.
    // And then there are pages, I start at page 1 and change pages as I go, but first page is 1.
    // How can you start a gallery not from page one?!
    // To my gallery I always add new paintings. One or two a week. I have a good business in town.
    // I also need a details page for each painting, so I can take one painting and read important information.
    // Like when did I buy the painting and how much was the painting. Of course the author and the name.
    // I keep all my paintings, never throw anything away. Just buy bigger house.
    // How much do you want for this system?
